# Law-Genie

Created an AI assistant for legal queries leveraging Gen AI technologies and an agentic framework. The system integrates language models with a scalable database to provide quick, accurate answers to legal questions, making legal resources more accessible and efficient. Additionally, implemented a user-friendly interface using Streamlit, enabling seamless deployment and interaction with the AI assistant.
